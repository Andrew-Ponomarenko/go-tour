<h1>Minecraft Pluto</h1>
<p>One Minecraft block's volume being equal to 1 cubic meter, one would need to fill 74.22 Deep Storage Units with Octuple Compressed Cobblestone to equal the volume of Pluto.</p>

<p>Volume of Pluto = 6.39×109 (6,390,000,000)km3, times it by 1,000,000,000 (convert to m3) (6,390,000,000,000,000,000) m3, divided by 2,000,000,000 (amount of blocks Deep Storage Unit can store) = 3,195,000,000, divided by 43,046,721 (amount of cobblestones an Octuple Compressed Cobblestones can store) = approx. 74.22</p>

<p>6.39×109 * 1,000,000,000 / 2,000,000,000 / 43,046,721 = 74.22</p>

<p>Furthermore, sextuple, septuple, and octuple compressed cobblestone are denser than a white dwarf: Assuming that stone in Minecraft is gabbro, and therefore has a density of 3: An average white dwarf has a density of about 1 megaton per cubic meter. The octuple compressed cobblestone has a density of 43,046,721(number of cobblestones in this block)*3(density of said stone)=~130 megaton per cubic meter. By dividing by 9 and 81, we find that septuple compressed cobblestone has a density of about 14 megaton per cubic meter, and sextuple has a density of around 1.5 megatons per cubic meter.</p>

<p>Assuming "N-uple compressed cobblestone" contains 9n cobblestone, then the 28-uple compressed cobblestone would be so dense it would have a Schwarzschild radius larger than itself, and would collapse into a black hole.</p>
